# Bristlecone

Bristlecone is a library for easily **composing** theoretical models into larger systems, and
subsequently conducting model-fitting and model-selection analyses on time-series data.
Although originally designed for the investigation of non-linear dynamics within ecological
and environmental sciences, the library can be used across finance, econometrics and
other fields that apply non-linear modelling techniques.

## Quick Start

Bristlecone is an F# .NET library. You can easily get started by installing
[the latest .NET SDK](https://dot.net). You may then simply use the
Bristlecone package in a script, application, or library.
The nuget package [is available here](https://nuget.org/packages/Bristlecone).

### To use in an F# script

## Example

This example demonstrates the layout of a model when defined in Bristlecone.

open Bristlecone // Opens Bristlecone core library and estimation engine
open Bristlecone.Language // Open the language for writing Bristlecone models

let hypothesis =

    let vonBertalanffy = Parameter "η" * This ** Parameter "β" - Parameter "κ" * This

    Model.empty
    |> Model.addEquation "mass" vonBertalanffy
    |> Model.estimateParameter "η" noConstraints 0.50 1.50
    |> Model.estimateParameter "β" noConstraints 0.01 1.00
    |> Model.estimateParameter "κ" noConstraints 0.01 1.00
    |> Model.useLikelihoodFunction (ModelLibrary.Likelihood.sumOfSquares [ "mass" ])

In the above snippet, a von Bertalanffy growth model is defined as a hypothesis to test. We then create an `EstimationEngine`, which defines the methodology for model-fitting. In Bristlecone, an `EstimationEngine` is created and customised using the F# forward pipe operator (for R users this may be familiar; this concept was adapted into the dplyr %&gt;% operator). The call to `testModel` generates random test data, and assesses whether the model-fitting method can accurately estimate known parameters.

## Samples &amp; documentation

An API reference is automatically generated from XML comments in the library implementation.

In addition, this documentation includes step-by-step example analyses. Each analysis may be downloaded
as an F# script or Jupyter notebook using the buttons at the top of each example page.

* [The predator-prey example](examples/predator-prey.html) covers basic model-fitting with Bristlecone.
  

* [The shrub-resource example](examples/shrub-resource.html) is a more
comprehensive example that covers model-fitting and model-selection (MFMS) with Bristlecone.
  

* The [API Reference](reference/index.html) contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules
and functions in the library. This includes additional brief samples on using most of the
functions.
