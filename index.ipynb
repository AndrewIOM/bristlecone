    "Bristlecone is a library for easily **composing** theoretical models into larger systems, and\n",
    "subsequently conducting model-fitting and model-selection analyses on time-series data.\n",

    "In the above snippet, a von Bertalanffy growth model is defined as a hypothesis to test. We then create an `EstimationEngine`, which defines the methodology for model-fitting. In Bristlecone, an `EstimationEngine` is created and customised using the F# forward pipe operator (for R users this may be familiar; this concept was adapted into the dplyr %\u0026gt;% operator). The call to `testModel` generates random test data, and assesses whether the model-fitting method can accurately estimate known parameters.\n",
