# Defining an Estimation Engine

The **estimation engine** is the definition of the method
through which model-fitting will take place, as defined
by Bristlecone's `EstimationEngine` type. If you are
competing multiple hypotheses, a single `EstimationEngine`
will suffice for all model hypotheses.

## Time Modes

Bristlecone can run models in either discrete time, or continuous time. When running models in continuous time, an integration function is required:

Currently only fixed timesteps are supported, but variable timestep support (e.g. for sediment core data) is planned.

Two integration functions are included:

Solver | Function | Description
--- | --- | ---
Runge-Kutta 4 (MathNet Numerics) | `Integration.MathNet.integrate` | A fourth-order Runge Kutta method to provide approximate solutions to ODE systems.
Runge-Kutta 547M (Open Solving Library for ODEs - Microsoft Research) | `Integration.MsftOslo.integrate` | A method based on classic Runge-Kutta, but with automatic error and step size control. [See the documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/osloUserGuide.pdf).


## Optimisation

Bristlecone supports optimisation functions that have the following type signature:

```fsharp
type Optimise<'data> = int -> int -> Domain -> ('data[] -> 'data) -> ('data * 'data []) list
```

There are two optimsation techniques currently built-in:

Method | Function | Description
--- | --- | ---
Amoeba (Nelder-Mead) | `Optimisation.Amoeba.solve` | A gradient-descent method.
MCMC Random Walk | `Optimisation.MonteCarlo.randomWalk` | A method based on classic Runge-Kutta, but with automatic error and step size control. [See the documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/osloUserGuide.pdf).


## Estimation Engines

To use Bristlecone functions requires a configured `EstimationEngine`. The easiest way is with the helper functions within the `Bristlecone` module:

Function | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`mkContinuous` | EstimationEngine | Default continuous engine
`mkDiscrete` | EstimationEngine | Default discrete model engine
`withContinuousTime` | t : Integrate<'a,'b> -&gt; engine: EstimationEngine<'a,'b> -&gt; EstimationEngine<'a,'b> | Transforms engine to continuous time mode, using the given integrator function.
`withConditioning` | c: Conditioning -&gt; engine: EstimationEngine<'a,'b> -&gt; EstimationEngine<'a,'b> | Choose how the start point is chosen when solving the model system.
