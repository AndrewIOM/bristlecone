# One example of a Chronology file can be found on the Example-Chronology tab in the Excel NOAA template file: https://www.ncei.[c]noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/templates/noaa-wdc-paleo-template.xlsm file. NOAA-Paleo intends to develop formats and variables for other dating tables including lead 210 and uranium-thorium. The format for these files is flexible at this time.
#
#--------------------
# Variables  
#
# [Rows containing "##" signs in columns one and two contain the definitions of variables. Each of these rows contains a short column label (user-defined, MUST have no spaces) followed by one tab-stop and then the variable name, which is a concatenated string of nine metadata components plus one free-text field called additional_information: what, material, error, units, seasonality, data_type, detail, method, data_format, additional_information. Contributors must use the WDS controlled vocabularies to assign terms to the nine metadata components. These are available in the Paleoenvironmental Standard Terms (PaST) Thesaurus and Example Lists file listed below. Make sure there is a comma separating each of the concatenated components, even where no value exists. In the ninth column an 'N' for numeric data format or 'C' for character data format is required. The free-text field is used for additional information not captured by the nine metadata components. Enclose any text containing commas in double quotes in order to differentiate it from the commas that separate variable components. Examples follow below.]
